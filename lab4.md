# Lab 4

## Write a javascript program for the following cases: 


1. Reverse an array without using the built-in reverse() method, for example, this array => [7,5,18,6,4,19,15,21,24].   
    - Stretch Goal: Bonus point if you solve it without using another declared array.

2. Given an array, let the array be [5,7,9,12,20,true,10,45,1,15,'hello world']
    - declare a new empty array
    - iterate through the array elements, if the element is divisible by 3, add the word 'Fizz' to the new array
    - if the element is divisible by 5, add the word 'Buzz' to the new array 
    -  if the element is divisible by 3 and 5, add the word 'FizzBuzz' to the array
    - if the element is not divisible by 3 or 5, ignore it and move on to the next element.
    - if the element is not a number but can be converted it to a number, convert it then do the above calculations.
    - if the element cannot be converted to a number, log the message "Invalid Input"

3. Given a string, let the string be "He*llo17 wor++ld3,"
    - iterate through the string characters, if the character is an english letter, convert it to its ASCII code and then push the ASCII code to a new array 
    - if the character is a number, push it directly to the new array as a number (not as a string)
    - if the character cannot be converted to a number and doesn't have an equivalent ASCII code, ignore it.
    - sort the resulting array in a descending order.

### Note: ASCII code is a 7-bit character code where every single bit represents a unique character, to know the ASCII code for english letters, visit this link:  [ASCII Code](http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html)
