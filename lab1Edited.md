# HTML Basics

## Objective: To understand HTML basics and establish website's structure

## We want to create an E-learning website using only HTML:

1. create the main page containing a header  with the title of the page and a nav bar with 3 links:
-  the first link takes you to another page you will create called (sign up.html)
-  the other two links are about us and contact us links, you can add any links you want here .
- in the main tag of the page add any image you want with a paragraph to add any description about the website .
- in the footer add the copy rights information
- the main page should look like this :
![main page](img\main.png) 

2.in the sign up page, create a form that gathers data about person that want to create an account, the fields that should be included in the form are:
- first name
- last name
- email, should match the email pattern. You should also add a message that tells the user to match the right pattern if they entered an invalid email.
**Note: for this requirement,search for the input pattern attribute and regex email pattern. you can also check the title attribute for the message**
- password
- select their gender 
- select birth month from a drop down menu
- write their birth year (number field)
- all the fields are required
- submit button, and when the form is submitted, the user will be taken to another page. (the courses page)
- the header of this page should contain the title and a link to the main page, and the footer should be exatly like the footer of the main page
- the sign up should look like this:
![sign up page](img\Signup.png)
3. in the third page, the header and the footer should match the sign up page, but the main should contain a third level heading that informs the user that their signing up is confirmed along with a table of the courses as the following image (the name of the courses and instructors as well as the links are up to you, you can add any names and links you want)
- the courses page should look like this:
- ![courses page](img\Onsubmit.png)

**Note: you have to add breaks and hr tag when needed as the pictures of the pages suggest, you also have to pay attention to when the text is bold**
