# React Hooks

## Objective: The objective of this assignment is to understand the concept of React Hooks and how they can be used to manage state and lifecycle events in a React application.

## Task:
1. Set up a new React project using create-react-app.
2. Create a new component called TodoList that will render a list of tasks.
3. Use the useState hook to create a state variable that will store an array of tasks.
4. Create a new component called AddTodo that will allow users to add new tasks to the list. This component should include a form with an input field and a button.
5. Use the useEffect hook to update the list of tasks whenever a new task is added or an existing task is deleted.
6. Create a new component called TodoItem that will render each individual task. This component should include a checkbox that will allow users to mark tasks as complete, as well as a button to delete the task.
7. Use the useCallback hook to memoize the function that deletes a task, to improve performance.
