# JavaScript Functions 

## Objective: To understand functions and deal with user interacting with the website

## Task:

## Part 1:

 ### Open your code for the E-learning System and do the following:
 - when the user first enters the main page, give them a prompt that asks them for their name, and when they enter it, give them a welcoming message with their name in it.
 - when they go to the sign up page, give them a short quiz with prompts so they cannot see the sign up page unless they finish the quiz, the questions should be like (this is a sample for the questions, you can use it or change it for any question you want but remember to keep the first question or change it to a similar question ):
    1. first question: enter a number between 1 and 100 that is divisible by 3,5,10 and 15.
    2. second question: What element does 'O' represent on the periodic table?
    3. third question: what's the capital of Italy ?
    4. fourth question: How many Continents are there? *Note: if their answer was close to the right answer by 1, let them know that they were close and give them a half point*
    - last question: How many players are in a soccer team?
    - calculate their score and let them know if they passed or failed
    *Note: each question has one point, they can get half a point on one of the questions, or more (up to you)*
- when they go to the courses page, ask them to rate the website from 1 to 5, if they enter an invalid number, let them try again and based on their rating, print, at the bottom of the page, a star image, the number of the images should equal to the user's rating .




## Part 2
### open your code for the previous lab (part 1) and:
- convert each program to a function and return the results.
- pass valid arguments for each case in the three programs (which means you will be calling each function multiple times to cover all the cases).


#### ***Note: from now on, always write your code in strict mode .***
