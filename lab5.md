# Introduction to JavaScript

## Objective: To understand the document object in JavaScript and deal with user interacting with the website

## Task:

 ### Open your code for the E-learning System and do the following:
 - when the user first enters the main page, give them a prompt that asks them for their name, and when they enter it, give them a welcoming message with their name in it.
 - when they go to the sign up page,ask them if they want to take a short quiz, if they agreed, give them the quiz, the questions should be like (this is a sample for the questions, you can use it or change it for any question you want but remember to keep the first question or change it to a similar question ):
    1. first question: enter a number between 1 and 100 that is divisible by 3,5,10 and 15.
    2. second question: What element does 'O' represent on the periodic table?
    3. third question: what's the capital of Italy ?
    4. fourth question: How many Continents are there? *Note: if their answer was close to the right answer by 1, let them know that they were close and give them a half point*
    - calculate their score and let them know if they passed or failed and their give them their score
    - if they did not agree to take the quiz, just give them an ok message and let them start with the sign up page.
    *Note: each question has one point, they can get half a point on one of the questions, or more (up to you)*
- when they go to the courses page, ask them to rate the website from 1 to 5, and based on their rating, print, at the bottom of the page, a star image, the number of the images should equal to the user's rating .
