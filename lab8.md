## Imagine you want to start an online book website
1. add multiple books to your page, you should render the book's name, image and price. They should look like this:

    ![BOOKS](img\BOOKS.PNG)

2. Add a form to allow users to add new books, and when they submit, the book should be rendered next to the other books

![form](img\booksForm.PNG)

![aftersubmit](img\aftersubmit.PNG)

![final](img\final.PNG)

3. when you refresh, the books added by the user **should not disappear** (all the books should be saved in the local storage)
4. Bonus: add a dropdown menu that has the following options : All, Available, Expired. And on change, the books will display differently. For example, when you click on available, only the available books will be rendered.
